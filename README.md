<p style="color: ivory">Economic stability means that people have the resources essential to a healthy life. Factors affecting economic stability include affordable housing; employment that provides a living wage; things that support employment, like worker protections, paid sick leave, and child care; and access to reliable transportation.

</p>
<p style="color: ivory">It occurs when inflation and unemployment rates are low, consumer spending is high, average incomes increase, and businesses are thriving.</p>

<p style="color: ivory"><b>Here in Kenya we have had many cases of power outages because the hot weather is affecting hydropower plants in the country.Severe conditions like drought are really affecting our economy so we need to find an excellent solution.That solution is cloud seeding.</p></b>
<p style="color: ivory"><b>Cloud seeding</b> is a weather modification technique that improves a cloud's ability to produce rain or snow by introducing tiny ice nuclei into certain types of subfreezing clouds. These nuclei provide a base for snowflakes to form.</p>
